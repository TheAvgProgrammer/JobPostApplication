# JobPostApplication

Hey in this, I worked with springboot web and handle GET, POST requests using "GetMapping" and "PostMapping" 
Also in this project I've returned "views" from my controller which apparently is not the best way to do things.
So maybe I'll be making another version of it where I return JSON data and not Views as that's a better way to do things

Cant wait to do that!!
